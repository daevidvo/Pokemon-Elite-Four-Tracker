## Description üìù

The Elite Four, the strongest trainers in their region. They climbed through the rankings and collected all of the gym badges just to stand at the very top.

And now you can search through all of their pokemon in one place!

Quickly and easily find out which ones are the strongest in their party so you can plan around how to fight each and every Elite Four member. Without preparation and through a lot of full revives, it'd be rough for any trainer to beat the strongest of them all. (Starting off, the database only seeds with information about the Elite Four from Kanto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh since those are my favorite games)

Through the usage of MySQL databases and Inquirer, this application is able to take in user input and perform various different functions such as: viewing a region's Elite Four pokemon, viewing a specific trainer's pokemon, and even adding in new regions, trainers, or pokemon yourself.
